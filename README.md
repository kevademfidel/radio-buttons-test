# Radio Buttons

Interactive and dynamic HTML form in JavaScript***.  The form should render multiple groups of radio buttons.


Specifications:

Add a submit button at the bottom that is only enabled when a valid option from all groups has been selected.

---
The radio-button groups should be dynamically rendered based on the following data, which you can imagine has come back from an API response:

```javascript
{
  menus: [
    // first group of radio-buttons
    [
      { id: '101', value: 'Vegetarian' },
      { id: '102', value: 'Nut allergy' },
      { id: '103', value: 'Halal' }
    ],
    // second group of radio-buttons
    [
      { id: '201', value: 'Cashew chicken' },
      { id: '202', value: 'Sweet and sour pork' },
      { id: '203', value: 'Stir fried Tofu' },
      { id: '204', value: 'Vegetable fried rice' },
      { id: '205', value: 'Pad Thai' },
      { id: '206', value: 'Massaman beef' },
    ],
    // third group of radio-buttons
    [
      { id: '301', value: 'Peanut sauce' },
      { id: '302', value: 'Oyster sauce' },
      { id: '303', value: 'Vegetable spring rolls' },
      { id: '304', value: 'Steamed rice' },
    ],
  ],
  rules: {
    // 'Vegetarian' is NOT compatible with 'Cashew chicken', 'Sweet and sour pork', 'Massaman beef', 'Oyster sauce'
    101: [201, 202, 206, 302], 
    // 'Nut allergy' is NOT compatible with 'Cashew chicken', 'Peanut sauce',
    102: [201, 301], 
    // 'Halal' is NOT compatible with 'Sweet and sour pork',
    103: [202], 
    // 'Vegetable fried rice' is NOT compatible with 'Steamed rice' (you don't need more rice... carb overload),
    204: [304],
    // 'Pad thai' is NOT compatible with 'Steamed rice' (Pad thai comes with noodles),
    205: [304],
  }
}
```

Initially, only items from the first group are able to be selected. Inputs in subsequent groups are to be initially disabled.

When an item from the first group is selected, valid items from the next group are enabled.

Valid items are specified in the set of rules.  This is an object where the key is the ID of an option, and the value is an array containing the IDs of options which are NOT compatible.

Items groups should remain disabled until an item in the previous group is selected.
